    "Recreational parks serve as a facilities that provide the space for sports, leisure or cultural activities in a community. The point of this project is to figure out whether the location of these parks have anything to do with their quality. To be more specific, I will be paying close attention to the quality of parks in areas inhabited by communities of lower income versus quality of parks in areas inhabited by communities of higher income. After conducting an explorative analysis of this specific relation, it's clear that *STATE FINAL RESULTS*"

    "To start this project, the first thing to do is to research the overall income of different communities in the city of San Diego. This step will help us rank different communities on the basis of wealth. With the help of a cencus conducted through the United States Cencus Bureau by the American Community Survey (ACS), along with extrapolating U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, Chris Kolmar and his team from Homesnacks ranked the wealthiest neighbourhoods in San Diego based on median income level from highest to lowest in 2020(1). North City and Carmel Valley rank the top two richest neighbourhood with median household income greater than 146,000 dollars. Mountain View and Memorial rank the lowest with median household income less than 31,000 dollars. You can view the rest of the list using the first reference link below.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next part of the project requires research on locations of recreational parks in San Diego to figure out the general placement of parks in the communities we've decided to focus on using the categorization based on community wealth from step one(3). This allows us to make sure we don't include neighbourhoods from step one that don't have any recreational parks because they would be irrelevant to the study.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final step involves making sure these recreational parks have existing, legitimate reviews on Yelp which is what I will use to determine a recreational park's quality. Once again, this step takes little time because I have access to a dataset in this project that provides me with yelp reviews of these recreational parks. I simply did this as a part of my backround research work to verify that I had legitimate data to work with beforehand(4).\n",
    "\n",
    "A similar study includes the \"determination of whether characteristics of community recreation center environments are associated with neighborhood income and childrenâ€™s use of the centers\" (McKenzie, 2014) which concluded that \n",
    "\"centers in more affluent neighborhoods seemed to be better off with regard to facilities, amenities, and aesthetics/incivilities\" (McKenzie, 2014)(2); which is in alignment with my hypothesis(5).\n",

    "Ideally, apart from the dataset I'm using in this analysis which is listed below, my project would have benefitted from sorting the data using a second dataset which would include information of different San Diego neighbourhoods with recreational parks and their median household income. I could have made a custom dataset using the same information I found through my background work, but because I was not sure of the privacy and ethics terms of using the data, I decided not to create this dataset. Additionally, if the datasets being used included information of recreational parks at a national level, we might have been able to establish a more distintive correlation between quality and location of recreational parks. But, the datasets I'm using in my analysis have been limited to the city of San Diego.\n",
