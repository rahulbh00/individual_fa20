    "Recreational parks serve as a facilities that provide the space for sports, leisure or cultural activities in a community. The point of this project is to figure out whether the location of these parks have anything to do with their quality. To be more specific, I will be paying close attention to the quality of parks in areas inhabited by communities of lower income versus quality of parks in areas inhabited by communities of higher income. After conducting an explorative analysis of this specific relation, it's clear that *STATE FINAL RESULTS*"

    "To start this project, the first thing to do is research the overall income of different communities in the city of San Diego. This step will help us establish which communities contrast each other on the basis of wealth, and it's these communities we will be focusing on comparing in our study. With the help of a cencus conducted through the United States Cencus Bureau by the American Community Survey (ACS), along with extrapolating U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, Chris Kolmar and his team from Homesnacks ranked the wealthiest neighbourhoods in San Diego based on median income level from highest to lowest in 2020(1). North City and Carmel Valley rank the top two richest neighbourhood with median household income greater than 146,000 dollars. Mountain View and Memorial rank the lowest with median household income less than 31,000 dollars. You can view the rest of the list using the first reference link below.\n",
